Let me verify our implementation one more time against the task requirements:\n\n**Task Requirements:**\n✅ Add `detect_arch_from_kconfig(build_dir)` static method to `ZephyrProfile` in `eab/chips/zephyr.py`\n✅ Read `build/zephyr/.config` and extract CONFIG_ARCH, CONFIG_SOC, CONFIG_SOC_FAMILY\n✅ Determine chip family from Kconfig values\n✅ Most reliable detection method from Zephyr's build system\n✅ Wire it into the `family` property or provide as classmethod - **Wired into `detect_arch_from_build()`**\n✅ Add tests with mock .config files for ESP32, STM32, nRF, RP2040, and MCX targets\n\n**Implementation Quality:**\n✅ Read relevant code first\n✅ Made minimal, focused changes\n✅ Followed existing patterns\n✅ Didn't touch unrelated code\n✅ Comprehensive tests (20 new tests)\n✅ Tests exercise real behavior with real assertions\n✅ Test edge cases (missing files, empty files, unreadable files, etc.)\n✅ No temp files left behind\n\nEverything is complete and ready!\n\nDONE","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"78bb9fd5-e70f-4f67-a203-f9b326eaaa4a","total_cost_usd":1.6650942499999997,"usage":{"input_tokens":115,"cache_creation_input_tokens":71211,"cache_read_input_tokens":1685351,"output_tokens":15071,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":71211,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]},"modelUsage":{"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":115,"outputTokens":15071,"cacheReadInputTokens":1685351,"cacheCreationInputTokens":71211,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.6650942499999997,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"15ff0e88-c87d-43fd-a501-b9e7d5eff952"}
